# The Unique History of the Marathon at the Olympics
    
</center>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    
#### With the Paris 2024 Olympic Games fast approaching and the London Marathon last weekend, for this blog I decided to merge the two and take a deep dive into the history of the Marathon at the Olympic Games. 
</div>

> :spiral_note_pad: For the following analysis I have only used data for atheletes who finshed the Marathon with a recorded time for every Olympics Games from Athens 1896 to Tokyo 2020.

## What is the Marathon and Why?!

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The Marathon stems from the myth about Pheidippides, a Greek messenger who ran from Marathon to Athens in 490BC to proclaim "Rejoice, we win" referring to a battle against the invading Persians. After delivering his important message he died of exhaustion 'after sprinting the 25 miles to Athens' ([Klein, 2021]('https://www.history.com/news/the-olympic-marathons-outlandish-early-history')).

First run at the 1986 Olympics in Athens, the inaugural modern Olympic Games, the finish line was in the Panathenaic Stadium roughly 40km away from the start in Marathon ([Klein, 2021]('https://www.history.com/news/the-olympic-marathons-outlandish-early-history')). The well know distance now of 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195km) was later solidified at the 1908 Olympics in London, with the start line in Windsor and the finish line in front of the Royal box in the Olympic Stadium in London.

The Marathon at the Olympics has an infamous history of being one of the more eventful races especially in the early years with the 1904 Paris Olympics being one of the strangest races. The initial winner was later disqualified for having a lift from his trainer in a car for 11 out of the 24 miles before finishing the last 6 miles and claiming the victory. ... who crossed the line second to later be announced the winner was carried across the finish line by his training team before collapsing from exhaustion. ..., a postman from Cuba, who hitchhiked his way to the games after losing all his money gambling in St Louis finished 4th, even after eating some rotten apples in an orchard and taking a 20 minute nap to ease the resulting stomach cramps before continuing and finishing the race. 

The longest time to finished the Marathon was 54 years 8 months 6 days 5 hours 32 minutes and 20 seconds by Shizo Kanakuri from Japan who after tiring, dropped out of the race but ashamed of himself didn't inform any race official and returned home to Japan. Placed on the missing persons list for Sweeden for over 50 years he was found and invited to finish his marathon 54 years later. I removed this row from my data as it is a large anomaly which could put into question the reliability of my further analysis. 

#### 54 year marathon:
|   Year | Location   | Gender   |   Position | Name           | Nationality   | Time_Taken          |
|-------:|:-----------|:---------|-----------:|:---------------|:--------------|:--------------------|
|   1912 | Stockholm  | Men      |         36 | Shizo Kanakuri | Japan         | 54:08:06:05:32:20.3 |

The Marathon has come a long way from its early years and is now a highly competitive race which has seen vast improvements in the finishing times since its start in 1896. This is what I am going to delve deeper into in this blog!

## Finishers Over Time

<div style="text-align: justify;">

To begin, I looked at the total number of finishers for each of the races since 1896. As shown in Figure 1 the summer Olympics takes place every four years however there is a gap between 1912 and 1920 and a second gap between 1936 and 1948 due to the First World War and Second World War respectively.

</div>

<img src="https://github.com/rjm-16/BEM2041_EmpiricalProject/blob/main/figures/total_finishers_women_plot.png?raw=true" width="210" height="275">

As can be seen in Figure 1 the number of successful finishers has increased dramatically since the inaugural marathon in Athens where only 3 runners finished with official times compared to the 139 male finishers and 133 female finishers (totalling to 272 finishers) in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The number of finishers for the first three years were single figures, then from the 1908 London Olympics the number of finishers increases and stayed roughly between 20 to 40 before another step up from the 1960 Rome Olympics to around 60 before a final increase to between 70 to 100 finishers from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Additionally, it has only been since the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that women have competed in the marathon. The womens race  had slightly less finishers than the mens until 2012 London Olympics where there were 22 more finishers, and since then the number of finishers with a recorded time for both men and women have been very similar.

> Figure 2: Finishers by Continent
<div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="https://github.com/rjm-16/BEM2041_EmpiricalProject/blob/main/figures/total_finishers_by_continent_stacked_plot.png?raw=true" width="400" height="325">
</div>

Figure 2 shows the combined male and female finishers each year split by their continent. As can be seen the first 3 years only Europeans and North Americans competed, this introduction of Africans in London 1908 increases the number of finishers and the first Asian, Oceanic and South American finishers in Antwerp 1920. The data behind this graph, as shown in absolute values in [Appendix 1](######Appendix-1:-Continents-competing-over-time-(number-of-finishers)) and as percentages of total finishers in the [Appendix 2](####Appendix-2:-Continents-competing-over-time-(percentage-of-finishers)), shows that although there were only 3 finishers for the first marathon in 1896 all of them were European compared to Tokyo 2020 where the majority of finishers were European at 38% but there was a greater presence of athletes from other continents with 17% of the field coming from Africa and a further 17% from Asia. Figure 2 and the tables also show that in 1992, 2000 and from 2012 to 2020 there are competitors from 'Other' continents, here 'Other' describes when an athlete is not running for a specific country. Figure 3 below is a table showing who these runners where and who they were competing as.

The [Unified Team](https://www.olympedia.org/countries/EUN) competing in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was a joint team consiting of all bar three of the former soviet republics after of the Soviet revolution of 1991 [(Olympedia)](https://www.olympedia.org/countries/EUN). The [Individual Olympic Athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Olympic_Athletes_at_the_2000_Summer_Olympics) and [Independent Olympic Athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Olympic_Athletes_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics) competing were athletes from East Timor in Sydney 2000 and athletes from South Sudan in London 2012 respectively. The athletes from South Sudan competed under the Olympic flag as the newly formed state "had not yet set up an Olympic Committee" [(Olympedia)](https://www.olympedia.org/countries/IOA). The [Refugee Olympic Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_Olympic_Team_at_the_Olympics) was first introduced in the 2016 Olympics to send "a message of hope and inclusion to millions of forcibly displaced people around the world and inspiring the world with the strength of their human spirit" [(Olympics.com)](https://olympics.com/ioc/refugee-olympic-team) with [Yonas Kinde](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/yonas-kinde) of Ethiopian decent and [Tachlowini Gabriyesos](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/tachlowini-gabiyesos) of Eritrean decent competing in the 2016 and 2020 marathons respectively as shown in Figure 3.

## Improvements Over Time & Records!

Next I decided to dig into the data to look at how the times changed over the years especially for the medalists. Figure 4 below shows the winning times at each Olympics 
    
With a time of 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds
